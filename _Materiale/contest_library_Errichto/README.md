C++ algorithm contest library
=============================

This library is intented to be used in online contests, or on ACM-style competitions. The target is to make it portable,
reusable and extremely easy to modify during the contest. The algorihtms are wrapped into classes/structs so they won't interfere
with your functions and variables.
